=== Metadata

Every new connection to the APM Server starts with a `metadata` stanza. This provides general metadata concerning the other objects in the stream.

Rather then send this metadata stanza multiple times, the APM Server hangs on to this information and reuses it to apply to every document that goes into elasticsearch.

The specification for metadata is outlined below:

[source,json]
----
include::./spec/metadata.json[]

NOTE: Metadata is stored under `context` when viewing documents in Elasticsearch.
